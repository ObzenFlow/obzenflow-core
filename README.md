# ObzenFlow

ObzenFlow is an upcoming high-performance, event-sourced stream processing framework that achieves equilibrium in the chaos of distributed systems. Where others see chaos, we find harmony through mathematical guarantees and architectural discipline.

ObzenFlow brings a strong philosophy of first-principles to distributed systems. We flourish in the stark reality of production failures, network partitions, and cascading failures.

## Core Philosophy

ObzenFlow is built on three foundational principles:

### 1. **Monitoring is Not Optional**
Every pipeline step MUST declare its monitoring taxonomy at compile time. No hidden defaults, no forgotten metrics.

### 2. **Zen-like Simplicity Through an Elegant DSL**
Clean, declarative syntax that reads like the problem domain. The framework enforces elegance.

### 3. **Compile-Time Everything**
No runtime pipeline construction. Everything is known at compile time for maximum performance and type safety.

## Status

Currently in active development. This crate is a placeholder while we prepare for the initial release.
